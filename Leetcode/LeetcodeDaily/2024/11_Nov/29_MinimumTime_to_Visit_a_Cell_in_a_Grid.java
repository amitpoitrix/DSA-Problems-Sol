/*
 * 2577. Minimum Time to Visit a Cell In a Grid
 * Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-time-to-visit-a-cell-in-a-grid/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-11-29
 * 
 * 
 * Approach:
 * 
 * This solution uses a priority queue-based BFS (similar to Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm) to find the minimum time to 
 * reach the bottom-right corner of the grid. 
 * 
 * Starting from (0,0), it explores neighboring cells and pushes them into the queue with the earliest possible 
 * time based on the grid's constraints. 
 * 
 * If a cell's time is less than or equal to current time + 1, it can be visited immediately; 
 * otherwise, the wait time is adjusted based on parity. 
 * 
 * The algorithm continues until the destination is reached or all possibilities are exhausted. 
 * 
 * If the destination is unreachable, it returns -1.
