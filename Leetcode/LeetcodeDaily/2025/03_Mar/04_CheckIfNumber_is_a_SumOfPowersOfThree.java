/**
 * 1780. Check if Number is a Sum of Powers of Three
 * Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-number-is-a-sum-of-powers-of-three/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2025-03-04
 * 
 * 
 * Approach 1: Using School Math
 * 
 * The idea is to find the highest power of 3 that is â‰¤ n.
 * Keep subtracting the largest possible power of 3 from n.
 * If n can be reduced to 0 without using the same power twice, return true; otherwise, return false.
 * 
 * Complexity:
 * Time: O(logn)
 * Space: O(1)

        // become 0 and at any moment, n is again greater than 3^power than return false as we 
        // can't represent n in the sum of distinct power of 3

 * Approach 2: Using Ternary Representation:
 * 
 * Convert n to base 3 (ternary).
 * If any digit in the ternary representation is 2, return false (since we can only use 0 or 1 powers of 3).
 * Otherwise, return true.

 * Time: O(logn)

        // Similar to finding Binary Representation of Decimal number
        // 12 by 3 = (0 * 3^3) + (1 * 3^2) + (1 * 3^1) (0 * 3^0)

/**
 * Approach 3: Using Take and Not Take (Recursion):
 * 
 * Explore two choices at each step: either take the current power of 3 or skip it.
 * If n becomes 0 in any recursive path, return true.
 * If no valid combination is found, return false.
 * This approach mimics the subset sum problem and is less efficient.

 * Complexity:
 * Time: O(2^(logn))
